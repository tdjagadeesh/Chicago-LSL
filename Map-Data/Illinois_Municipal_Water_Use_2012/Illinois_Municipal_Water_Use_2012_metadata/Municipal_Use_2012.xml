      <abstract>This dataset was developed using reported water use collected through the Illinois Water Inventory Program (IWIP) and the ESRI U.S. Populated Place Areas feature class published in 2013. The original feature class uses 2010 U.S. Census Bureau data to define the areal extent of municipal boundaries and uses American Community Survey data to estimate population in 2012. Municipalities include both incorporated places and census designated places. Not all communities in Illinois report water use through the Illinois Water Inventory Program, therefore some communities are not represented with this dataset, or do not have reported self-supplied or purchased water values listed in the attribute table.Point locations listed for towns represent the centroid of the municipal boundary and are in Clarke_1866_Lambert_Conformal_Conic projection. Fields:FAC_ID = Illinois Facility Identification numberFAC_TYPE = Facility Type (CDP= Census Designated Place)SOURCE = Facilities classified as “groundwater”, “surface water” or “mixed”SOURCE_2 = Same as SOURCE, but Lake Michigan users are separated from the “surface water” classSW_TYPE = Surface water typeSW_ORIGIN = Name of specific surface water bodyGW_TYPE = Groundwater TypeGW_ORIGIN = Name of specific aquiferBUYS_FROM = Name of facility that community purchases water fromSELLER_FAC_ID = Illinois Facility Identification number of the sellerSS_2012_GALLONS = amount of water in gallons self-supplied by facility reported for 2012P_2012_GALLONS = amount of water in gallons purchased by facility reported for 2012TOTAL_2012_GALLONS = total amount of water in gallons used by facility reported 2012SS_2012_MGD = amount of water in millions of gallons per day (mgd) self-supplied by facility reported for 2012P_2012_MGD = amount of water in millions of gallons per day (mgd) purchased by facility reported for 2012</abstract>
      <purpose>This dataset depicts the source of water for 1224 municipalities throughout the state of Illinois for the year 2012. Additional attributes include the reported amount of self-supplied or purchased water in gallons and in million gallons per day (mgd). Not all communities reported for the year 2012.</purpose>
